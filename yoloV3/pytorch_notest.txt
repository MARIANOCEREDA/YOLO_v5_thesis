Sequential module:
A Sequential is a container that can hold other modules and apply them in sequence to an input tensor. 
It is the simplest way to build a neural network in PyTorch.

import torch.nn as nn
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 20),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(20, 10),
)

The Sequential will then apply the modules in the order they are listed to the input tensor. In this case,
the input tensor will be first passed to the Linear layer with 10 input features and 20 output features. 
The output of the Linear layer will then be passed to the ReLU activation function. Finally, the output of 
the ReLU layer will be passed to the Linear layer with 20 input features and 10 output features.
The Sequential is a very convenient way to build neural networks in PyTorch. It makes it easy to create 
complex networks with multiple layers.
